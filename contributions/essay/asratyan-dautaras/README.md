## Description
Amazon Web Services has become one of the staples of any modern platform development. It would be interesting to take a deeper look into how AWS may influence use of DevOps practices, even if it is not obvious on the surface.

The focus will be on:
- Benefits of AWS compared to a clasically deployed server setup
- What development approaches AWS encourages
- Draw a parallel between these AWS approaches and the core ideas of DevOps development
- Give concrete examples of what AWS services correspond to what DevOps practices
